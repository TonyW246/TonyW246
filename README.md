Hi, Iâ€™m @TonyW246

Interested in algo trading. Have developed a succesful trade signal generator in python, running on AWS EC2 Linux2 or Ubuntu.
So far have used historical data. Now looking to digest real-time data and place trades automatically using IB brokerage.
As I write, Autumn 2021, it's very early days. I have installed IB's Trader Workstation and I'm about to try and talk to it using
Ewald de Wit's ib_insync. I'm a complete newb with this - but it seems that people hold it in very high regard as being a well documented interface for the IB API
